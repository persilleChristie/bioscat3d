    "The eigenmode source can also be used to launch [planewaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_wave) in homogeneous media. The dispersion relation for a planewave is ω=|$\\vec{k}$|/$n$ where ω is the angular frequency of the planewave and $\\vec{k}$ its wavevector; $n$ is the refractive index of the homogeneous medium. This example demonstrates launching planewaves in a uniform medium with $n$ of 1.5 at three rotation angles: 0°, 20°, and 40°. Bloch-periodic boundaries via the `k_point` are used and specified by the wavevector $\\vec{k}$. PML boundaries are used only along the x-direction."

    "Note that this example involves a `ContinuousSource` for the time profile. For a pulsed source, the oblique planewave is incident at a given angle for only a *single* frequency component of the source. This is a fundamental feature of FDTD simulations and not of Meep per se. Thus, to simulate an incident planewave at multiple angles for a given frequency ω, you will need to do separate simulations involving different values of $\\vec{k}$ (`k_point`) since each set of ($\\vec{k}$,ω) specifying the Bloch-periodic boundaries and the frequency of the source will produce a different angle of the planewave. For more details, refer to Section 4.5 (\"Efficient Frequency-Angle Coverage\") in [Chapter 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5366) (\"Electromagnetic Wave Source Conditions\") of [Advances in FDTD Computational Electrodynamics: Photonics and Nanotechnology](https://www.amazon.com/Advances-FDTD-Computational-Electrodynamics-Nanotechnology/dp/1608071707)."
